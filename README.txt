Feldman,professor at Florida State University. This implementation is done in Ada95,and use actually Ada83 constructs : namely tasks and rendez-vous.It is made of the following packages :– Screen is a simplified ANSI terminal emulator, used to do pseudo-graphics inconsole mode, using ASCII characters;– Wall handles the management of walls and bricks;– Bricks provides a task (and accessory functions) to move bricks in the game;– Arrival provides function to handle timing aspects of the game (pace,movement of bricks, etc.);– Tetris is the main entry-point of the game.This implementation is far form being efficient.Here you can find a reimplementation using solely the Ravenscar profile.Implementation details can be found in tetris.adb.
